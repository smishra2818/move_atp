# Create Autonomous Database #

## Introduction

Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) is a fully managed Oracle database service with “self-driving” features on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). An application can securely connect to ATP with the proper credentials and a wallet.

The following lab guide shows how to provision and securely connect to ATP.

Estimated Time: 1 hour

### Objectives

* Create Autonomous Database on Oracle Cloud.
* Connect Autonomous Database using SQL Developer through wallet.

### Prerequisites

* Web Browser
* SQL Developer 19.1 or higher
* Always ensure you are in your correct Region and Compartment

## Task 1: Login to Oracle Cloud ##

1. From your browser login into Oracle Cloud


## Task 2: Provision ATP ##

   Provision the Autonomous Transaction Processing database (ATP) with the steps below.

1. Select your assigned Region from the upper right of the OCI console.

2. From the hamburger menu (top left side), select Autonomous Transaction Processing.

3.  Select your Compartment. You may have to drill in (click “+”) to see your compartment.

4. Select Workload Type Transaction Processing.

5. Click Create Autonomous Database.

6. Choose your compartment.

7. Enter any unique name (maybe your name) for your display and database name.
   The display name is used in the  Console UI to identify your database.

8. Ensure Transaction Processing workload type is selected.

9. Select **Shared Infrastructure** for deployment type.

10. Choose database version 19c.

11. Configure the database with **2 cores and 1 TB storage**.

12. Uncheck Auto scaling. We will enable it later.

13. Enter a password. The username is always ADMIN. (Note: remember your password)

14. Select Allow secure access from everywhere for this workshop.  
    As a best practice when you deploy your own application, you should select network access to be from Virtual cloud network.  

15. Do not check the box Configure Access Control Rules.
    However the best practice is to configure Access Control to your ATP.

16. Select BYOL license type.

17. Click Create Autonomous Database.

    Your console will show that ATP is provisioning. This will take about 2 or 3 minutes to complete.

    You can check the status of the provisioning in the Work Request.

## Task 3: Download the Wallet

Once your ATP service is running we can connect a client to ATP securely with the Oracle Wallet.

1. Click on the details of your ATP.

2. Select DB Connection.

3. Select Instance Wallet for the Wallet Type.

4. Download the wallet to your laptop.

5. Enter a password for the wallet.

## Task 4: Connect to ATP using SQL Developer

In this lab section you will connect to the ATP with Oracle SQL Developer and browse the ATP configuration. SQL Developer is an Oracle DBA and developer client tool.

Please note that most of the database settings and parameters cannot be modified in a fully-managed Oracle Autonomous Database (ATP and ADW) and that is the whole point of the autonomous service, it runs by itself.

### Start SQL Developer

1. Start SQL Developer from your client.
2. Click + to create a new connection.
  ![](./images/sql-developer.png)

3. Enter a connection name.

4. Enter ADMIN as the user.

5. Enter the password you used to create your ATP.

6. Check Save Password.

7. Select Connection Type as Cloud Wallet and Browse for your wallet.

8. Browse and select your service. i.e.,: "< your ATP name >\_tp". Note there are five services, select the **tp**  service.

    About connection services:

    - High – for long queries, high parallelism, low SQL concurrency.
    - Medium – for medium queries, parallelism, medium concurrency.
    - Low – for short queries, no parallelism, high concurrency.
    - TPurgent – for high priority transaction processing.
    - TP – for standard transaction processing.

9.  Test the connection and Save your connection for later use. Then click Connect.

    "**Note:**" Ensure that you use **ADMIN** user to view any database configuration.

10. From your SQL Developer worksheet run the test query below against a sample database that is
    already in ATP.

    ```
     <copy>SELECT channel_desc,
      TO_CHAR(SUM(amount_sold),'9,999,999,999') SALES$,
      RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(amount_sold)) AS default_rank,
      RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(amount_sold) DESC NULLS LAST) AS custom_rank
      FROM sh.sales, sh.products, sh.customers, sh.times, sh.channels, sh.countries
      WHERE sales.prod_id=products.prod_id
     AND sales.cust_id=customers.cust_id
      AND customers.country_id=countries.country_id
      AND sales.time_id=times.time_id
      AND sales.channel_id=channels.channel_id
      AND times.calendar_month_desc IN ('2000-09','2000-10')
      AND country_iso_code='US'
      GROUP BY channel_desc;</copy>

     ```
 11. Click **F5** or the **Run Script** button. Verify the query executes and results are displayed.

     Run it again.  Why was it faster?

You have successfully provisioned and connected SQL Developer to Autonomous Database (ATP) and validated the connection.

You may now proceed to the next lab.
